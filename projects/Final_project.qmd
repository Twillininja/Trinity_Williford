## Microglia: Homeostatic, Intermediate, and Disease Associated

Aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), are associated with chronic, sterile inflammation (inflammaging). Microglia, the resident CNS immune cell, responds to insults by altering their phenotype and thus increasing their phagocytic and signaling capacities. However, it is unclear how this reactivity affects aging or AD pathogenesis. The prevailing view is that microgliosis protects against damage, but during aging and AD neuropathology, chronic microglial hyperactivation may promote inflammation and disease.

In our studies, we have identified three types of microglia: homeostatic, intermediate, and disease-associated (DAMs). Homeostatic microglia are considered to maintain a healthy environment while DAMs are inflammatory. During aging, the proportion of DAMs relative to homeostatic and intermediate microglia changes. Here, we explore the genetic components that may contribute to these changes.

## Bulk-RNAseq of Microglia Phenotypes Across Ages

Here, I am analyzing Bulk-RNAseq data that describes four different conditions: Young Homeostatic, Old Homeostatic, Old Transition (Intermediate), and Old DAMs.

### Installing Packages

We begin by installing the necessary packages needed for our data analysis.

```{r}
## install packages and open library 
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
install.packages("ggrepel")
install.packages(c("parallelly", "purrr", "tidytext"))


## Load packages for data analysis
library(DESeq2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

## Make sure you can find your file
file.exists("DAMs-full-matrix.csv")

## read csv formatted data
dam <- readr::read_delim("DAMs-full-matrix.csv", delim = ",")
```

### Tidy Data

After importing my data file, I needed to filter and tidy the data to contain the protein coding RNA segments. I also needed to remove the normalized counts since DESeq works solely with raw counts. On top of this, my descriptions (second image) in my csv did not contain any conditions (based on age and microglia state) that match my sample. DESeq compares samples based on conditions (not sample name), so I had to create a new data.frame to make my comparisons.

```{r}

## Filter gene expression data to protein-coding genes only
filtered_dam_gene <- dam %>%
  filter(`Gene Type` == "protein-coding")

## Extract raw counts only (remove normalized columns)
filtered_dam_raw <- filtered_dam_gene[, -34:-77]

## Extract gene annotation info (e.g. gene type, description)
dam_descriptions <- filtered_dam_gene[, -1:-66]


## Check for duplicate genes
any(duplicated('Gene Symbol')) == FALSE
head(filtered_dam_raw, 2)

## Reshape data to long format
dr_long <- filtered_dam_raw %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:33, names_to = "Samples", values_to = "Count")

## Create sample metadata frame (One row per sample)
dr_description <- dr_long %>%
  select(Samples) %>%
  distinct()  
```

On top of filtering and creating a new data.frame, I double checked to see if I had unique genes or not. The goal is to have unique expression to limit DESeq package confusion during data analysis.

```{r}
## Collapse duplicate genes by summing counts
filtered_dam_raw <- filtered_dam_raw %>%
  group_by(`Gene Symbol`) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), sum), .groups = "drop") %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "Gene Symbol")
```

Here is a continuation of tidying dr_description. For recap, I elongated filtered_dam_raw (count data.frame) so that my sample names would become rows instead of columns. Once I had this, I needed to remove the Gene Symbols and Counts. Below, I am adding the conditions to dr_description so that I can compare my samples based on their condition.

```{r}
## Annotate each sample with its condition
dr_description <- dr_description %>%
  mutate(Condition = case_when(
    Samples %in% paste0("Y", 1:8, "Homeo(raw)") ~ "Young",
    Samples %in% paste0("O", 1:8, "Homeo(raw)") ~ "Old Homeostatic",
    Samples %in% paste0("O", 1:8, "Transition(raw)") ~ "Old Transition",
    Samples %in% paste0("O", 1:8, "DAM(raw)") ~ "Old Diseased",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))
```

Unfortunately, DESeq must have whole numbers. My data has decimals, so I had the data rounded and created a new data.frame for differential expression.

```{r}
## Convert counts to integers (rounding)
filtered_dam_raw_int <- round(filtered_dam_raw)

# Confirm all values are integers
stopifnot(all(apply(filtered_dam_raw_int, 2, function(x) all(x == floor(x)))))
```

Finally, I made sure my samples in my filtered_dam_raw_int matched the conditions in my dr_description_clean.

```{r}
## Finalize metadata: align to count matrix
dr_description_clean <- dr_description %>%
  filter(Samples %in% colnames(filtered_dam_raw_int)) %>%
  distinct(Samples, .keep_all = TRUE)

# Set rownames and reorder to match count matrix columns
rownames(dr_description_clean) <- dr_description_clean$Samples
dr_description_clean <- dr_description_clean[colnames(filtered_dam_raw_int), ]
```

### DESeq Analysis and Plotting

Now, with my data tidy, it is ready for differential expression analysis.

```{r}
## Create DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(
  countData = filtered_dam_raw_int,
  colData = dr_description_clean,
  design = ~ Condition
)

## Check data
dds

## Run DESeq
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

Now that we have run DESeq, we will begin comparing our groups and making MA plots!

```{r}

## Get results for a specific comparison, e.g., Old Homeostatic vs Young
res <- results(dds, contrast = c("Condition", "Old Homeostatic", "Young"))

## View summary and top results
summary(res)
head(res[order(res$padj), ])

## Plot MA plot
plotMA(res, main = "DESeq2: Old Homeostatic vs Young", ylim = c(-5, 5))

## Remove NA adjusted p-values and Sort for up- and down-regulated genes
res_clean <- as.data.frame(res)
res_clean$gene <- rownames(res_clean)
res_clean <- res_clean[!is.na(res_clean$padj), ]

## Create new labels for code with upregulated and downregulated genes
top_up <- head(res_clean[order(-res_clean$log2FoldChange), ], 5)
top_down <- head(res_clean[order(res_clean$log2FoldChange), ], 5)

## Combine the different genes
top_genes <- rbind(top_up, top_down)

## Plot
p1 <- ggplot(res_clean, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1, color = "gray") +
  geom_point(data = top_genes, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange), color = "purple", size = 2) +
  geom_text_repel(data = top_genes, aes(label = gene),
                  size = 3, color = "black", max.overlaps = Inf) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Old Homeostatic vs Young",
       x = "Mean Expression (log10 scale)",
       y = "Log2 Fold Change")


```

For reference, a positive fold change is indicative of increased gene expression in the first group while a negative fold change is decreased gene expression. In the case above, a positive fold change means increased expression while a negative fold change is decreased gene expression for the Old Homeostatic group.

```{r}
## Get results for a specific comparison, e.g., Old Homeostatic vs Old Transition
res2 <- results(dds, contrast = c("Condition", "Old Homeostatic", "Old Transition"))

res2

## View summary and top results
summary(res2)
head(res2[order(res2$padj), ])

## Plot MA plot
plotMA(res2, main = "DESeq2: Old Homeostatic vs Old Transition", ylim = c(-5, 5))

## Remove NA adjusted p-values and Sort for up- and down-regulated genes
res_clean2 <- as.data.frame(res2)
res_clean2$gene <- rownames(res_clean2)
res_clean2 <- res_clean2[!is.na(res_clean2$padj), ]

## Create new labels for code with upregulated and downregulated genes

       y = "Log2 Fold Change")
```

```{r}
## Get results for a specific comparison, e.g., Old Homeostatic vs Old Diseased
res3 <- results(dds, contrast = c("Condition", "Old Homeostatic", "Old Diseased"))

res3

## View summary and top results
summary(res3)
head(res3[order(res3$padj), ])

## Plot MA plot
plotMA(res3, main = "DESeq2: Old Homeostatic vs Old Diseased", ylim = c(-5, 5))

## Remove NA adjusted p-values and Sort for up- and down-regulated genes
res_clean3 <- as.data.frame(res3)
res_clean3$gene <- rownames(res_clean3)
res_clean3 <- res_clean3[!is.na(res_clean3$padj), ]

## Create new labels for code with upregulated and downregulated genes
top_up3 <- head(res_clean3[order(-res_clean3$log2FoldChange), ], 5)
top_down3 <- head(res_clean3[order(res_clean3$log2FoldChange), ], 5)

## Combine genes
top_genes3 <- rbind(top_up3, top_down3)

## Plot
p3 <- ggplot(res_clean3, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1, color = "gray") +
  geom_point(data = top_genes3, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange), color = "purple", size = 2) +
  geom_text_repel(data = top_genes3, aes(label = gene),
                  size = 3, color = "black", max.overlaps = Inf) +

  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Old Homeostatic vs Old DAMs",
       x = "Mean Expression (log10 scale)",
       y = "Log2 Fold Change")
```

Continuing to plot different comparisons.

```{r}
## Get results for a specific comparison, e.g., Young vs Old Transition
res4 <- results(dds, contrast = c("Condition", "Young", "Old Transition"))

res4

## View summary and top results
summary(res4)
head(res4[order(res4$padj), ])

## Plot MA plot
plotMA(res4, main = "DESeq2: Young vs Old Transition", ylim = c(-5, 5))

## Remove NA adjusted p-values and Sort for up- and down-regulated genes
res_clean4 <- as.data.frame(res4)
res_clean4$gene <- rownames(res_clean4)
res_clean4 <- res_clean4[!is.na(res_clean4$padj), ]

## Create new labels for code with upregulated and downregulated genes
top_up4 <- head(res_clean4[order(-res_clean4$log2FoldChange), ], 5)
top_down4 <- head(res_clean4[order(res_clean4$log2FoldChange), ], 5)

## Combine genes
top_genes4 <- rbind(top_up4, top_down4)

## Plot
p4 <- ggplot(res_clean4, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1, color = "gray") +
  geom_point(data = top_genes4, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange), color = "purple", size = 2) +
  geom_text_repel(data = top_genes4, aes(label = gene),
                  size = 3, color = "black", max.overlaps = Inf) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Young vs Old Transition",
       x = "Mean Expression (log10 scale)",
       y = "Log2 Fold Change")
```

At this point, we are repeating code to view all comparisons.

```{r}
## Get results for a specific comparison, e.g., Old Homeostatic vs Old Diseased
res5 <- results(dds, contrast = c("Condition", "Young", "Old Diseased"))

res5

## View summary and top results
summary(res5)
head(res5[order(res5$padj), ])

## Plot MA plot
plotMA(res5, main = "DESeq2: Young vs Old DAMs", ylim = c(-5, 5))

## Remove NA adjusted p-values and Sort for up- and down-regulated genes
res_clean5 <- as.data.frame(res5)
res_clean5$gene <- rownames(res_clean5)
res_clean5 <- res_clean5[!is.na(res_clean5$padj), ]

## Create new labels for code with upregulated and downregulated genes
top_up5 <- head(res_clean5[order(-res_clean5$log2FoldChange), ], 5)
top_down5 <- head(res_clean5[order(res_clean5$log2FoldChange), ], 5)

## Combine genes
top_genes5 <- rbind(top_up5, top_down5)

## Plot
p5 <- ggplot(res_clean5, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1, color = "gray") +
  geom_point(data = top_genes4, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange), color = "purple", size = 2) +
  geom_text_repel(data = top_genes5, aes(label = gene),
                  size = 3, color = "black", max.overlaps = Inf) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Young vs Old DAMs",
       x = "Mean Expression (log10 scale)",
       y = "Log2 Fold Change")
```

### Assembling MA Plots: Up and Down-regulated Genes

Now, we want to have a nice picture with all of our plots together, so we will patch several of the graphs and save it as an image.

```{r}
## Display all ggplots together
install.packages("patchwork")
library(patchwork)

## Saving patched variables as one 
 p25 <- p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5
 
## Saving plot
p25

ggsave("my_microglia_plot.png", plot = p25, width = 14, height = 9, dpi = 300)
```
