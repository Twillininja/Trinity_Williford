## Bio
I am a graduate student in the Microbiology and Immunology Department at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. I recently joined the lab of Dr. Iker Etchegaray and Dr. Bill Freeman where we are studying the intersection between the Immune system and Nervous system (Neuroimmunology) in the context of inflammaging.

## Research Goals
My research interests include neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the role of microglia, the resident CNS immune cell, in disease progression. My hope is to understand microglial phenotypic changes, phagocytic, and signaling capacities in response to inflammation. As of now, it is unclear how this reactivity affects AD pathogenesis. Although the prevailing view is that microgliosis protects against damage, chronic microglial hyperactivation may promote disease. In our AD studies, we have identified an unexplored increase of Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC-I) in microglia, which may play a critical role in microglial plasticity. This lead my lab and I to focus on understanding the mechanisms behind MHC-I in the brain. We hope to determine if MHC-I suppression early in disease exacerbates AD pathology or if MHC-I inhibition after disease development slows progression. Maybe, through the exploration of these mechanisms, we can find remedies to AD.

## Experience
I have expertise in Immunology and Neurology, microglia, flow cytometry, cell isolation, and micro-dissections. I have mentored undergraduate and maintain good academic standing with my institution.
